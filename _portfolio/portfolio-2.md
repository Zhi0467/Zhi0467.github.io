*Expository* really just means lack of novelty here.
-  [Numerical methods for differential equations](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/Numerical_Methods_for_Differential_Equations.pdf).
- [Repeated games](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/drp_report.pdf).
- [Birkhoff polytopes and a related conjecture](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/249final_notes.pdf).
- [The history of Antarctica](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/an.pdf).

Nothing is guaranteed to be comprehensive here, but I hope they're interesting readings.
- [LCH and separable, but not sigma compact.](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/mono_LCH_example.pdf).
