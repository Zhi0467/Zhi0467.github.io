Coffee beans do not contain cockroaches but coffee grounds and instant coffee may have traces of roaches and other insects. Unfortunately, this is inevitable with food manufacturing in factories and warehouses where bugs thrive.

Yes, there are ground-up cockroaches in your pre-ground coffee. My mind was blown, but consider how hard it is to sort out cockroaches from a huge pile of coffee beans, it makes sense they just grind the whole thing. I mean, we consume insects unconsciously all the time so... I may switch to drinking tea instead.
