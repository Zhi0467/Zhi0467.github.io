[Here](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV. (last updated: Dec 2, 2024)

Bio
------
*Update - Apr 15, 2025:* I am now an incoming Data Science PhD student @UCSD starting this Fall.

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics, from [*the school of gifted young at USTC*](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn), my name is Zhi (志), you can simply call me Z. I'm honored to be supervised by [Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io) (grokking [@HKU](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/hku_cer.pdf).), [Andrés R. Vindas Meléndez](https://math.hmc.edu/arvm/) (algebraic combinatorics @Berkeley), and [Quan Wen](http://www.wenlab.org) (neuroscience @USTC)!



Research Interests
------
I'm interested in using mathematics to unveil how artificial and biological computational systems *learn and generalize*.
- *Learning theory*, especially feature learning and compression.
- *Reinforcement Learning*
- *Computational neuroscience*, especially the relation between connectivity and activity.
- *ML for science*: time series forecasting and its applications in market prediction and climate science.

Publications
------
Lee Eon, Andrés R. Vindas-Meléndez, and Zhi Wang. *Generalized Snake Posets, Order Polytopes, and Lattice-Point Enumeration*, 2024, submitted. [arxiv:2411.18695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18695). 

Personal Interests
------
*sleep faster, die slower; build more, suffer less.*
- learning new languages. I've been learning French and Spanish! 
- 🏀🛹🏄🏼🥊.
- the art of dramatic writing, cinema analysis, and potentially directing films.
- Rubik's cube.
