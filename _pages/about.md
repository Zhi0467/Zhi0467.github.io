Welcome to Zhi's homepage! (last updated: May 25, 2024)
------
[Here](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.

Bio
------
Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics, my name is Zhi(志), you can simply call me Z. I'm honored to be supervised by [Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io) and [Andrés R. Vindas Meléndez](https://math.hmc.edu/arvm/) for my undergraduate research in machine learning theory and combinatorics, respectively, and I'm currently seeking for opportunities to continue my study as a PhD student in either applied math or ieor!

Research Interests
------
Learning theory, explain various emergent behaviors in machine learning (e.g. grokking), learning regimes and transitions in over-parameterized models, and feature learning.

Besides,
- I'm generally interested in analysis.
- how machine learning and theoretical neuroscience relate to each other.

Personal Interests
------
I value work life balance and I spend a decent amount of time on the following things:
- learning new languages. I'm fluent in both Mandarin Chinese and English, moreover, I've been learning French and Spanish for a while, so we can try to communicate in these two languages as well!
- picking up heavy objects then put them back.
- playing around with piano and eletronic music.
- Rubik's cube
