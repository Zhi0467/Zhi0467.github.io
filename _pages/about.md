[Here](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV. (last updated: Dec 2, 2024)

I am a PhD student at UC San Diego advised by [Tianhao Wang](https://tiiao.github.io). 

I am interested in reinforcement learning, context/memory, and continual learning, with the ultimate goal of building general and long-horizon agents. I also work on machine learning theory.


Publications
------
- Lee Eon, Andrés R. Vindas-Meléndez, and Zhi Wang. **Generalized Snake Posets, Order Polytopes, and Lattice-Point Enumeration**, 2024, submitted. [arxiv:2411.18695](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18695). *We derived the Ehrhart and h-star polynomials for the generalized snake posets, with closed-form formulae for the two extreme cases, and obtained a monotonicity result using a novel technique that bridges combinatorics and lattice polytopes, extending several previous results.*
