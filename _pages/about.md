[Here](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.

Bio
------
Hi! I'm a third-year undergraduate student majoring in mathematics, my name is Zhi(志), but feel free to call me Sid or Z etc. I'm honored to be supervised by [Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io) and [Andrés R. Vindas Meléndez](https://math.hmc.edu/arvm/) during my undergrad years, and I'm currently seeking for opportunities to continue my study as a PhD student.

Research Interests
------
The rise of efforts to narrow the gap between two fundamental approaches in applied mathematics is intriguing to me: first principle style (*rigorous theory and interpretability*) and data-driven style (*learning the function from large datasets*).

- First principle → data-driven: learning theory, various emergent phase-change-like behaviors in machine learning (e.g. grokking), why over-parameterization works, and algorithms that are underpinned by clear mathematical or physical intuitions (e.g., compressed sensing, UMAP). In short, developing theory like a scientist.

- Data-driven → first principle: using AI to discover and prove theorems, formalize mathematics, and use machine learning to tackle high-dimensional challenges in computational mathematics.

Besides,
- I'm generally interested in combinatorics and analysis.
- Making videos in manim and coding personalized chatbots are of great interests to me.

Personal Interests
------
I value work life balance and I spend a decent amount of time on the following things:
- picking up heavy objects then put them back.
- taking long walks in the mountains.
- playing around with piano and eletronic music.
- learning new languages.
