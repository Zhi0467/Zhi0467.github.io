Welcome to Zhi's homepage! (last updated: Aug 23, 2024)
------
[Here](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.

Bio
------
Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics, from *the school of gifted young at USTC*, my name is Zhi (志), you can simply call me Z. I'm honored to be supervised by [Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io) and [Andrés R. Vindas Meléndez](https://math.hmc.edu/arvm/) in machine learning theory and combinatorics, respectively, and I'm currently actively seeking for opportunities to continue my study as a PhD student!

Research Interests
------
- *Learning theory*, emergent behaviors (e.g. grokking), learning regimes and transitions in over-parameterized models, and feature learning.
- *computer graphics and AIGC*.
underlying both areas, *non-convex optimization* is of great interest to me.

Besides, I'm generally interested in analysis and optimization.

Publications
------
Currently working on two papers.

Personal Interests
------
I value work life balance and I spend a decent amount of time on the following things:
- learning new languages. I've been learning French and Spanish for a while, so we can try to communicate in these two languages as well!
- picking up heavy objects then put them back.
- playing around with piano and electronic music.
- Rubik's cube
