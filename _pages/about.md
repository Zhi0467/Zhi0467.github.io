Bio
======
I'm Batman.



Research Interests
------
I've noticed a rise in the efforts to narrow the gap between two fundamental approaches in applied mathematics: first principle style (emphasizes rigorous theory and interpretability) and data-driven style (emphasizes experiments and learning from datasets).

- First principle → data-driven: learning theory, how to establish a theory for various emergent behaviors in machine learning, why over-parameterization works, and how to utilize pure math theory to develop and optimize algorithms (e.g., compressed sensing, UMAP).

- Data-driven → first principle: using AI to discover and prove theorems, formalize mathematics, and use machine learning to tackle high-dimensional challenges in computational mathematics.

Besides,
- I'm generally interested in combinatorics and analysis.
