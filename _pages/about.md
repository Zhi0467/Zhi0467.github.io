Bio
------
Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics, my name is Zhi(志), but feel free to call me Sid, Z, big Z... any one of those above, as long as it's not "Hey you!". I'm honored to be supervised by [Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io) and [Andrés R. Vindas Meléndez](https://math.hmc.edu/arvm/), and I'm currently seeking for opportunities to continue my study as a PhD student.

Research Interests
------
The rise of efforts to narrow the gap between two fundamental approaches in applied mathematics is intriguing to me: first principle style (emphasizes rigorous theory and interpretability) and data-driven style (emphasizes experiments and learning from datasets).

- First principle → data-driven: learning theory, how to establish a theory for various emergent phase-change-like behaviors in machine learning, why over-parameterization works, and how to utilize pure math theory to develop and optimize algorithms (e.g., compressed sensing, UMAP).

- Data-driven → first principle: using AI to discover and prove theorems, formalize mathematics, and use machine learning to tackle high-dimensional challenges in computational mathematics.

Besides,
- I'm generally interested in combinatorics and analysis.

[Here](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV.

Personal Interests
------
I value work life balance and I spend a decent amount of time on the following things:
- picking up heavy objects then put them back.
- taking long walks in the mountains.
- playing around with piano and eletronic music.
- learning new languages.
