[Here](http://Zhi0467.github.io/files/CV.pdf) is my CV. (last updated: Sept 23, 2024)

Bio
------
Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in mathematics, from [*the school of gifted young at USTC*](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn), my name is Zhi (Âøó), you can simply call me Z. I'm honored to be supervised by [Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io) (learning theory, grokking), [Andr√©s R. Vindas Mel√©ndez](https://math.hmc.edu/arvm/) (algebraic combinatorics), and [Quan Wen](http://www.wenlab.org) (neuroscience, undergrad thesis)!

 I'm actively seeking for opportunities to continue my study as a PhD student!

Research Interests
------
I'm interested in using mathematics to unveil and understand the complexity in both artificial and biological computation models.
- *Learning theory*, emergent behaviors (e.g. grokking), learning regimes, feature learning, and properties of weight matrices needed for generalizable learning.
- *computational and mathematical neuroscience.*


Besides, I'm also generally interested in analysis and optimization.

Publications
------
Currently working on two papers.

Personal Interests
------
I value work life balance and I spend a decent amount of time on the following things:
- learning new languages. I've been learning French and Spanish! 
- picking up heavy objects and üèÄüõπ.
- the art of dramatic writing, cinema analysis, and potentially directing films.
- Rubik's cube.
